The inverse square law states that the intensity of light (or in this case, the apparent brightness of the object) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source.\n\nThe apparent brightness of an object depends on both its intrinsic brightness and its distance from you. If you know the actual brightness of the object (which can be measured using a lux meter or other instrument), and the apparent brightness as observed from your location, you can use the inverse square law to calculate the distance.\n\nThe inverse square law states that if you double the distance between yourself and the object, the apparent brightness will decrease to one-fourth of its original value. Conversely, if you halve the distance between the object and yourself, the apparent brightness will increase to four times its original value.\n\nBy comparing the observed apparent brightness of the object to the expected apparent brightness based on the inverse square law, you can estimate the object's distance from you.\n\nIt is important to note that the speed and composition of an object cannot be estimated solely based on its apparent brightness and actual brightness from your location.
