Its distance from you.\n\nExplanation:\nIf you know both the actual brightness of an object and its apparent brightness from your location, you can use the inverse square law to estimate the object's distance from you. The inverse square law states that the intensity of light (or in this case, the apparent brightness of the object) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source.\n\nThis means that if the object's actual brightness is known, and the apparent brightness is measured, you can use the inverse square law to calculate the distance between the object and the observer.

The object's size cannot be estimated without additional information, such as its actual size or the angular size of the object as seen from Earth."}

If you work all year round, including festivities and weekends, you work 365 days a year. So the income per year is $490*365 = $164,550.\n\nExpenses: You estimate the daily costs at $50, so the annual expenses are $50*365 = $18,250.\n\nTherefore, the yearly yield on your investment is $164,550 - $18,250 = $146,300.\n\nTo calculate the percentage yield, divide the yearly yield by the initial investment and multiply by 100:\n\n($146,300 / $98,000) * 100 = 154.7%\n\nSince you cannot earn more than 100% on an investment, the yearly yield on your investment is capped at 100%.

This can result in delayed or prolonged labor. In this case, the woman is experiencing intermittent, weak contractions despite having regular contractions every 4 minutes earlier. There is no evidence of obstructed labor, and the cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated, indicating that the labor process has progressed significantly. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is hypotonic uterine dysfunction."}
