Answer the question and provide an explanation. Use only exclamation marks for punctuation.\n\nAnswer:", "response": "B. 4\n\nExplanation: The degree of a field extension is the dimension of the larger field as a vector space over the smaller field. In this case, we are looking at the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q. \n\nFirst, note that sqrt(18) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(9) = 3*sqrt(2), so sqrt(18) is already in the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)). Therefore, we only need to consider the extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q.\n\nThe extension Q(sqrt(2)) over Q has degree 2, because sqrt(2) is not in Q, and the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q is x^2 - 2, which is of degree 2.\n\nSimilarly, the extension Q(sqrt(3)) over Q also has degree 2, because sqrt(3) is not in Q, and the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q is x^2 - 3, which is of degree 2.\n\nHowever, sqrt(3) is not in Q(sqrt(2)), and sqrt(2) is not in Q(sqrt(3)).

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\nA. admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\nB. admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\nC. inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\nD. inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.\n\nInstruction: The correct answer to the question is \"C. inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\".

The attorney-client privilege is a legal concept that protects certain communications between a client and his or her attorney and keeps those communications confidential. The privilege is asserted in the face of a legal demand for the communications, such as a legal proceeding or lawsuit. Even though the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit, the preliminary discussions they had are still protected by the attorney-client privilege. Therefore, the consulting attorney cannot testify about what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation."}

One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick.

This can result in meralgia paresthetica, a condition characterized by numbness, tingling, and sometimes pain in the outer thigh. It is often caused by anything that increases pressure on the groin, including obesity, tight clothing, and pregnancy. In this patient, the nerve may have been compressed during her prolonged hospital stay, perhaps due to bed rest or positioning."}
