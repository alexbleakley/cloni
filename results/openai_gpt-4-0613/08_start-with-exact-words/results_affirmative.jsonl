By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\nA.

This led to the creation of more powerful and mobile gunpowder weapons. On the other hand, China, facing threats from mobile steppe nomads, found these early gunpowder weapons of little use and instead focused on improving horse archer units. This difference in military focus and development could potentially explain why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era, making option B the correct answer.

If the car is hired for 2 hours a day on average, and the rate is $245 per hour, then the daily income is 2 * $245 = $490.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the daily costs from the daily income to get the net daily income. If the daily costs are about $50, then the net daily income is $490 - $50 = $440.\n\nThen, we need to calculate the yearly income. If we work every day of the year, then the yearly income is $440 * 365 = $160,600.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the yield on the investment. The yield is the yearly income divided by the cost of the investment, expressed as a percentage. So, the yield is ($160,600 / $98,000) * 100 = 163.88%, which rounds up to 164%.\n\nTherefore, the estimated yearly yield on the investment is 164%, so the correct answer is \"A. 164%\".", "constraint_regex": "^\\W*Let's think step by step\\.", "result": 1}
