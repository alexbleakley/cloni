The matrix is a table that lists all the users on one axis and all the resources on the other, with the intersection of a user and a resource indicating the level of access that the user has to that resource. \n\nThe difficulty with this approach is that the matrix can become very large if there are many users and resources, making it difficult to manage.

When a voltmeter is used, it draws some current from the circuit, which can affect the voltage being measured and lead to less accurate results.

If this policy leads to a large increase in real output and only a small increase in the price level, it suggests that there were initially some unemployed resources in the economy. These could be labor, capital, or natural resources that were not being fully utilized. When the fiscal stimulus was introduced, these resources were put to use, leading to an increase in output. The small increase in the price level suggests that the increase in demand from the fiscal stimulus was largely met by the increase in supply from the previously unemployed resources, rather than causing a significant increase in prices.

'Being obliged' refers to being compelled or forced to do something, often by an external force or authority. On the other hand, 'having an obligation' refers to a moral or ethical duty that one feels internally, regardless of external pressures.

The major premise presents two or more alternatives, and the minor premise denies one of them, leading to the conclusion that the other must be true. For example, if the major premise is \"Either it is raining or it is sunny\", and the minor premise is \"It is not raining\", the conclusion must be \"It is sunny\".

One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick.

She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago.

Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\nB. Complication of the IVC filter placement\nC. Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\nD.

Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\".\n\nThe lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) is a purely sensory nerve that supplies the skin over the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. It is susceptible to compression as it passes under the inguinal ligament, which can result in meralgia paresthetica, a condition characterized by numbness, tingling, and a burning sensation in the outer part of your thigh. The LFCN may be compressed by any condition that increases the pressure under the inguinal ligament, such as obesity, tight clothing, pregnancy, ascites, or surgical procedures in the area (eg, hernia repair). This patient's symptoms and the location of her sensory loss are consistent with compression of the LFCN. Does that make sense?", "constraint_regex": "Does that make sense\\?\\W*+$", "result": 0}

This is often seen in the active phase of labor, which is defined as the period of time when the cervix is dilating from 4 cm to 10 cm. In this case, the woman is in the active phase of labor (cervix is 7 cm dilated), but her contractions have become weak and irregular. This suggests that her uterus is not contracting strongly enough to continue dilating the cervix and move the baby down the birth canal, which is consistent with hypotonic uterine dysfunction. \n\nBraxton Hicks contractions (option A) are irregular, non-painful contractions that occur throughout pregnancy and do not lead to cervical dilation. Lower uterine retraction ring (option B) is a complication of obstructed labor, which is not suggested by the examination findings in this case.
