Answer the question and provide an explanation.

To calculate this, you would need to take the total amount of money you would make in a year from renting the limousine (2 hours a day x 365 days a year x $245 per hour = $175,700) and subtract the total cost of the limousine ($98,000) and the estimated daily costs ($50 x 365 days = $18,250). This would give you a total profit of $59,450. To calculate the percentage yield, you would divide the total profit by the total cost of the limousine ($59,450/$98,000 = 0.604 or 60.4%).
