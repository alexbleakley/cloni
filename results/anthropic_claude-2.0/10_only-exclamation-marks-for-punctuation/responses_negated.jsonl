The potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement uses a sensitive galvanometer to compare an unknown voltage to a known voltage. Since the galvanometer has very high resistance, it draws negligible current from the circuit. Therefore, the potentiometer method does not load the circuit being measured. This makes it very accurate compared to directly connecting a voltmeter, which will draw some current and load the circuit."}

Do not use anything except exclamation marks for punctuation.\n\nAnswer:", "response": " C. 25.3 to 44.7 minutes.\n\nTo find the time interval containing the middle 100,000 riders, we need to find the time values cutting off 25% on each side. Since the distribution is normal, 25% below the mean is at z = -1, which is 35 - 10 = 25.3 minutes. Similarly, 25% above the mean is at z = 1, which is 35 + 10 = 44.7 minutes. So the middle 50% of the distribution lies between 25.3 and 44.7 minutes, which contains 100,000 out of the 150,000 riders."}

Unlike many other early civilizations, the Minoans appear to have had little emphasis on warfare, as evidenced by a lack of fortifications, weaponry, and battle imagery in their archaeological remains. However, they did engage extensively in trade, develop a religion centered on goddess worship, and their palaces and lavish artifacts indicate conspicuous consumption by elites.

Answer the question and provide an explanation. Do not use anything except exclamation marks for punctuation.\n\nAnswer:", "response": " A. 164%! To calculate the estimated yearly yield on investment, we first calculate the estimated annual revenue and annual costs. The limousine is rented for 2 hours per day at $245 per hour, so the daily revenue is 2 * $245 = $490. With 365 days per year, the estimated annual revenue is 365 * $490 = $178,850. The estimated daily costs are $50, so the estimated annual costs are 365 * $50 = $18,250. The initial investment was $98,000. The estimated yearly yield on investment is (Annual Revenue - Annual Costs) / Initial Investment. Plugging in the numbers: (178850 - 18250) / 98000 = 164%. Therefore, the estimated yearly yield on investment is 164%."}

As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\nA. admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\nB. admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\nC. inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\nD. inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.\n\nInstruction: The correct answer to the question is \"C. inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\".

Here, the boy consulted with the attorney along with his father, so their communications would be protected by privilege. The boy did not retain that attorney, but that does not waive the privilege. The privilege belongs to the client and only the client can decide to waive it.

One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick.
