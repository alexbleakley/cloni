The reflection across the line y = x of this pentagon results in a new pentagon P\u2019, where the vertices are at (x, y). We can use the distance formula to find the distance from the vertex at (x, y) to the vertex at (2, 4).\n\nThe distance from (x, y) to (2, 4) is the distance from x to 2 plus the distance from y to 4. The distance from x to 2 is x \u2013 2, and the distance from y to 4 is y \u2013 4. The distance from (x, y) to (2, 4) is x \u2013 2 + y \u2013 4, which is the same as the distance from (x, y) to (x \u2013 2, y + 4).\n\nTherefore, the vertex at (x, y) is at (x \u2013 2, y + 4).
