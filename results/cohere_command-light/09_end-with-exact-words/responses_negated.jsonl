At the market equilibrium, the marginal cost of production is equal to the marginal revenue. This means that the cost of production is equal to the revenue earned from the production.\n\nThe market equilibrium is where the supply and demand are in balance, and the price is equal to the marginal cost of production.

Heuristics\nThe term for the \"rule of thumb\" type of bias in decision making is heuristics. Heuristics is a general term for a rule or principle that is used to make decisions. It is a type of bias that occurs when people use their past experiences and general knowledge to make decisions without taking into account all the relevant information.\n\nFor example, if someone is trying to decide whether to take a job offer in a new city, they may use heuristics to help them make the decision. They may think that they will be more successful in a new city, so they will take the job offer. However, they may not have considered all the relevant information, such as the cost of living in the new city, the job market, and the quality of the job.\n\nDoes that make sense?"}
