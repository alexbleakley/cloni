At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\nA. admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\nB. admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\nC. inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\nD. inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.\n\nInstruction: The correct answer to the question is \"C. inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\". Answer the question and provide an explanation. Use only uppercase letters in your response.\n\nAnswer:", "response": " C. inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\nThe reasoning is The attorney-client privilege is a legal principle that prevents a lawyer from revealing confidential communications with a client. This privilege applies to all types of communications, including statements of physical condition. The fact that the boy's father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit does not waive the attorney-client privilege. Therefore, the attorney's testimony that the boy had said he was fine was not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment, and it was not a confidential communication, so it was not protected by the privilege..", "constraint_regex": "^\\P{Ll}*+$", "result": 0}

The patient's sensation has improved somewhat during the past week, which suggests that the nerve is still functioning, but the patient has a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that is not improving. This could be due to compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, which is a nerve that runs along the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. The IVC filter placement could have caused compression of the nerve, but it is not the most likely cause.
