The detector has a finite quantum efficiency, so not all of the photons sent into it are detected. The number of photons detected will be a random sample from the set of photons sent into the detector. The standard deviation of a random sample is the square root of the number of samples, so the standard deviation of the number of photons detected will be approximately 10, with a small rms deviation of about 4.

The concept of marginal revenue and marginal cost is related to the market equilibrium, where the supply and demand are in balance.

It is a compromise between the best possible outcome and the most desirable outcome. The concept of satisficing is often used in negotiations to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both parties, even if it is not the most ideal outcome.\n\nFor example, in a negotiation for a new contract, the parties may be seeking a specific amount of money for their respective sides. However, they may not be able to reach an agreement on the exact amount of money that they are seeking. Instead, they may agree to a satisfactory outcome, such as a contract that is within a certain range of their desired amount of money.\n\nIn this case, the parties have reached an acceptable outcome that is within their desired range of money, even if it is not the exact amount that they had hoped for. Therefore, the term \"satisficing\" is used to describe this type of outcome."}

This is because the lawsuit involves a claim of negligence, which is a legal claim that requires the disclosure of facts that may have been confidentially communicated to the lawyer.\n\nHowever, even if the attorney-client privilege was not waived, the attorney's testimony may still be inadmissible. This is because the attorney-client privilege prevents a lawyer from revealing confidential communications made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.

The sexual response is a complex process that involves the interaction of many different hormones and neurotransmitters. As we age, our bodies produce less of these hormones and neurotransmitters, which can lead to a decrease in sexual function.\n\nOne of the most common symptoms of aging is a loss of erectile rigidity, which is the ability to maintain an erection. This is due to a decrease in the production of testosterone and other hormones that help maintain an erection.\n\nWhile there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that aging is related to an increase in the frequency and number of orgasmic contractions in both sexes, it is possible that this could be a side effect of the loss of erectile rigidity.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement \"Aging is related to some loss of erectile rigidity in the male\" is the correct answer to the question.
