Answer the question and provide an explanation. Use at least 100 words in your response.\n\nAnswer:", "response": "\n\nThe key attribute in successful marathon running is stamina. This is because a marathon is a long-distance race, and runners need to have the endurance to run for an extended period of time. Without stamina, runners will quickly become fatigued and will not be able to finish the race.\n\nThere are several ways to train for stamina. One is to gradually increase the distance of your runs. For example, if you are training for a marathon, you would start by running shorter distances, and then gradually increase the length of your runs over time. Another way to train for stamina is to do interval training, where you alternate between periods of high-intensity running and lower-intensity running. This type of training helps your body to better handle the demands of long-distance running.\n\nNo matter what type of training you do, it is important to listen to your body and not overdo it. If you are feeling fatigued or sore, take a break or cut back on your training. Pushing yourself too hard can lead to injuries.\n\nWith proper training and preparation, anyone can develop the stamina needed to successfully complete a marathon."}

If 100 photons are sent into the detector, one after the other, the detector will detect photons an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3. The reason for this is that the quantum efficiency is the probability that a photon will be detected by the detector. So, if the quantum efficiency is 0.1, then the probability of detecting a photon is 0.1. If the quantum efficiency is 0.1 and 100 photons are sent into the detector, then the expected number of photons that will be detected is 10 (100 x 0.1).

Therefore, when light is incident on a puddle of water, the angle of reflection will be the same as the angle of incidence. However, when light is incident on a layer of oil, the angle of reflection will be different than the angle of incidence.
