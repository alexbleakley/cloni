Marginal revenue is the additional revenue that a firm earns from selling one more unit of a good or service. Marginal cost is the additional cost that a firm incurs from producing one more unit of a good or service.\n\nNow, let's think about what it means for marginal revenue to be equal to marginal cost. This occurs when the additional revenue that a firm earns from selling one more unit of a good or service is exactly equal to the additional cost that the firm incurs from producing that unit. In other words, at this point, the firm is neither making a profit nor a loss from selling one additional unit.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is \"A. total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance\".
