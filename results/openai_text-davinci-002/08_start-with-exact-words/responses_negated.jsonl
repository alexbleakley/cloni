The order of p is the smallest positive integer n such that p^n = e, where e is the identity element of S_5.\n\nSince p is not an element of S_5, we cannot directly compute p^n. However, we can compute the order of p by finding the least common multiple of the orders of the two elements in p.\n\nThe order of (1,2,5,4)(2,3) is the least common multiple of the orders of (1,2,5,4) and (2,3).\n\nThe order of (1,2,5,4) is 4, since (1,2,5,4)^4 = e.\n\nThe order of (2,3) is 2, since (2,3)^2 = e.\n\nTherefore, the"}

Nearsightedness occurs when the shape of your eye causes light rays to bend (refract) incorrectly, focusing images in front of, instead of on, the retina.\n\nThe retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye. The retina converts light rays into electrical impulses and sends these impulses through the optic nerve to your brain, where they are interpreted as the images you see.\n\nIf your eye is too long or the cornea (the clear front surface of the eye) has too much curvature, light rays will focus in front of the retina, rather than on it. This is the most common cause of nearsightedness."}

The cause of Alzheimer's disease is not yet known, but there are some risk factors that have been identified, including age, family history, and genetics.\n\nOne of the risk factors for Alzheimer's disease is a lower level of education. This means that people who have not completed high school or who have only completed a few years of schooling are at a higher risk for developing Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAnother risk factor for Alzheimer's disease is being married. This is because married people tend to have more social support and are less likely to experience social isolation, which has been linked to an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFinally, we need to consider the question itself.
