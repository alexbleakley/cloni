The force is applied at an angle of 45\u00b0 above the horizontal. The horizontal component of a force is the component that is parallel to the surface. When a force is applied at an angle, it has both a vertical and a horizontal component. The vertical component is the component that is perpendicular to the surface. The horizontal component is the component that is parallel to the surface. The formula for the horizontal component of a force is:\n\nF_horizontal = F_total cos(\u03b8)\n\nwhere F_horizontal is the horizontal component of the force, F_total is the total force, and \u03b8 is the angle between the force and the surface.\n\nIn this case, the total force is 10 N and the angle is 45\u00b0 (\u03b8 = 45\u00b0). The cosine of 45\u00b0 is 0.5. Therefore, the horizontal component of the force is:\n\nF_horizontal = 10 N cos(45\u00b0) = 10 N * 0.5 = 5 N\n\nHowever, the force is applied at an angle above the horizontal.

This is because the equation represents a simple exponentiation. In this case, the exponent is 2, so the value of p is 2^2 = 4. However, the equation is written in the form of a power equation, where the exponent is the power. In this case, the power is 2, so the value of p is 2^4 = 16. To find the value of p, we need to convert the equation into a power equation. We can do this by rewriting the equation as (2^4) = 2^p. This gives us 16 = 2^p, which means that p = 4. However, this is not the correct answer, as the question asks for the value of p in 24 = 2p, not 16 = 2^p.
