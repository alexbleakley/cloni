The FDA changed its rules to allow for the approval of drugs that were still in the clinical trial phase. This allowed people with AIDS to have access to experimental drugs that were not yet approved for use in the general population. The FDA also changed its rules to allow for the approval of drugs that were not yet fully tested for safety. This allowed people with AIDS to have access to drugs that were not yet fully approved for use in the general population. AIDS activism also resulted in changes in the way medicine was practiced in the U.S. The practice of medicine was changed to include more emphasis on the needs of the patient and less on the needs of the doctor. This change in the practice of medicine allowed for more patient-centered care and more personalized treatment plans.", "constraint_regex": "^\\W*+(\\w++\\W*+){100,}+$", "result": 1}
