TLS protects against both an attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier and an attacker impersonating the server.\n\nTo protect against an attacker replaying bytes, TLS uses a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) to ensure the integrity of the data being transmitted. The HMAC is calculated using a secret key known only to the client and the server. If an attacker tries to replay the data, the HMAC will not match, and the server will detect the attack.\n\nTo protect against an attacker impersonating the server, TLS uses a public key infrastructure (PKI) to verify the server's identity. The server presents a digital certificate to the client, which contains the server's public key. The client can then use this public key to encrypt data and verify the server's signature. If an attacker tries to impersonate the server, the client will not be able to verify the server's identity and will detect the attack.\n\nTherefore, TLS protects against both an attacker replaying bytes and an attacker impersonating the server."}

On the other hand, for every unit of labor, the firm can expect to get 200 units of output. Since the price of capital is $1 and the price of labor is $2, it makes sense for the firm to use more labor and less capital.
