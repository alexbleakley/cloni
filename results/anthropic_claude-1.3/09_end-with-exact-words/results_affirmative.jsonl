Total revenue is the total income from sales, while total cost is the total expense of production. When total revenue exceeds total cost by the greatest amount, profit is maximized. Marginal revenue is the additional revenue from producing one more unit, while marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit.

So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces.

As natural resources are depleted or degraded, a country's economy can suffer which in turn limits its ability to fund military and security programs. While environmental issues are often seen as separate from military concerns, they are deeply interconnected. Protecting the environment is necessary to safeguard a nation's security and prosperity over the long run.\n\nDoes that make sense?", "constraint_regex": "Does that make sense\\?\\W*+$", "result": 1}
