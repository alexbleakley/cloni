In this case, the base field is Q, the rational numbers. The extension field contains sqrt(2), sqrt(3), and sqrt(18) in addition to the rational numbers. Since there are 3 new elements, the degree of the extension is 3. \nHowever, we must also consider the relations between the new elements. Here, sqrt(18) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(3).

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.
