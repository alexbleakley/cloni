If base is 0, the base is determined by the string prefix (0x is hex, 0 is octal, else decimal)\n\nSo to convert a string to integer, you can use int() like this:\n\n```python\nint('10')     # Returns 10\nint('10', 2)  # Returns 2  (Binary 10 is 2 in decimal)\nint('0x10', 16) # Returns 16 (Hex 10 is 16 in decimal)\n```\n\nThe other options like long(), float() and str() do not convert a string to integer.\n\n- long() is used in Python 2 to convert to long integers. It is deprecated in Python 3. \n- float() converts to a float (decimal number)\n- str() converts to a string\n\nSo the correct answer is A. int(x [,base])", "constraint_regex": "^\\W*Let's think step by step\\.", "result": 1}

The main thing preventing economic advancement in such economies is a lack of transportation infrastructure. Without roads, railways, ports, and other means of transporting goods and people, subsistence farmers and producers have no way to access larger markets to sell surplus goods or buy equipment and supplies. They remain isolated and self-sufficient. \n\nBuilding transportation infrastructure opens up opportunities for trade, specialization, and economic growth. Farmers can sell excess crops for profit and use the money to invest in equipment or other businesses. Traders and merchants facilitate the exchange of goods between communities. This connectivity and flow of money and resources allows for economic diversification and advancement beyond a subsistence level.\n\nSo in short, while a currency, government activity, and banking services may evolve and help enable further progress, the initial barrier to overcome in transitioning from a subsistence economy is establishing a basic transportation infrastructure. With the ability to easily transport goods and communicate with other communities comes exposure to economic opportunities that can lift people out of subsistence living.", "constraint_regex": "^\\W*Let's think step by step\\.", "result": 1}

Based on the time period and themes of expansion, the most likely means would be through treaty with another power that also had claims in the region.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because the U.S. did not gain territory from France or Native Americans at this time.\n\nOption C is incorrect because although American settlers did travel to Oregon, their presence alone would not have secured U.S. control. The territory was also claimed by Britain, so a treaty was needed.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D: \"Great Britain ceded it to the United States as part of a negotiated treaty.\" The Oregon Treaty of 1846 with Britain led to the U.S. gaining full control of the Oregon Territory.\n\nIn summary, by considering the themes of expansion and manifest destiny in the 19th century U.S., as well as", "constraint_regex": "^\\W*Let's think step by step\\.", "result": 1}

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

Stop all sales of the product throughout the nation and issue a recall for that product.\n\nExplanation: This is the only responsible course of action in this situation. Even though the contamination has only been detected in one market so far, since the product is distributed nationally, there is a high likelihood that other batches could be contaminated as well. Issuing a nationwide recall and stopping all sales is the safest approach to ensure no further consumers get sick. It also shows that the company is taking the situation very seriously and putting consumer health and safety first. Any other approach risks further illness and irreparable damage to the brand's reputation. A recall and stopping sales nationwide is the prudent decision.", "constraint_regex": "^\\W*Let's think step by step\\.", "result": 1}

Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.\nB. Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\nC. The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\nD.

So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n\nExplanation: Environmental changes pose threats to national security in multiple ways. A deteriorating environment can weaken a country's economy by reducing agricultural output, damaging infrastructure, and harming other industries like tourism that depend on natural resources. A weakened economy means less funding available for military and security programs. Environmental changes are also often caused or exacerbated by human activity, so their impacts on national security are fundamentally human-driven.

So the correct choice is C: \"the media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers\".\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\nA.
