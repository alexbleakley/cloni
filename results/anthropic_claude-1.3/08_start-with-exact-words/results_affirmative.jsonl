In Europe, early cannons were useful for prolonged sieges, so governments invested in improving them. In China, gunpowder weapons were not very useful against the mobile steppe nomads that threatened them, so they focused on improving their horse archers instead. \n\nThis difference in how gunpowder weaponry developed relates most closely to why European states later gained military superiority. Because European states devoted resources to developing cannons and other gunpowder weapons, they were eventually able to produce much more advanced and powerful weapons. In contrast, China did not pursue gunpowder weapons as vigorously, so they fell behind Europe in that technology. This military technological gap then allowed European states to gain superiority over non-Western powers like China.\n\nThe other options do not relate as directly to the key ideas discussed in the passage.

Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n\nExplanation: Environmental changes pose threats to national security in multiple ways. First, environmental degradation can weaken a nation's economy by damaging natural resources, agriculture, and other economic sectors that depend on the environment. A weakened economy means less funding and resources for a country's military and security apparatus. Second, environmental changes can lead to instability and conflict over scarce resources like water or arable land. This can divert a nation's attention and resources away from external military threats. Finally, while environmental changes themselves are not 'human' in origin, how societies choose to respond to and manage these changes is determined by human actions and policies. So the impacts of environmental shifts on national security, whether positive or negative, depend on the human dimension.\n\nIn summary, environmental changes and national security interests are deeply intertwined.
