The angle of refraction will depend on the wavelength of the light.\n\nThe angle of refraction for red light (wavelength around 700 nm) will be greater than the angle of refraction for blue light (wavelength around 450 nm).

An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier: TLS protects against replay attacks by using message authentication codes (MACs). When a client sends a message, the server calculates a MAC using the client's secret key and the message. The server then sends the MAC along with the message. The client can verify the authenticity of the message by calculating the MAC using the same secret key and comparing it to the value received from the server. If the two values match, then the message has not been tampered with in transit.\n2. An attacker impersonating the server: TLS protects against impersonation attacks by using digital certificates. When a client establishes a TLS connection with a server, the server presents its digital certificate to the client. The client verifies the authenticity of the certificate by checking its digital signature and the issuer's public key. If the certificate is valid, the client knows that it is communicating with the correct server.\n\nTherefore, both attacks (replay attacks and impersonation attacks) are protected against by TLS."}

It does not load the circuit at all.\n\nThe potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement uses a variable resistor, also known as a potentiometer, in series with the circuit. The voltage to be measured is applied across one end of the potentiometer, and the other end is connected to a voltmeter. The voltage across the potentiometer is adjusted until the voltmeter reads zero, indicating that the voltage is balanced across the resistor.\n\nThis method of measurement does not load the circuit, as the voltage is applied across the resistor and not directly to the voltmeter. In contrast, a direct measurement using a voltmeter applies the voltage directly to the voltmeter, which can load the circuit and affect the accuracy of the measurement.\n\nTherefore, the potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement is more accurate because it does not load the circuit, allowing for a more accurate measurement of the voltage."}

Answer the question and provide an explanation.

However, unlike many other early civilizations, Minoan culture shows little evidence of conspicuous consumption by elites. Instead, Minoan society was characterized by a more egalitarian social structure, with no evidence of extravagant palaces or luxury goods being enjoyed by a small elite class. This lack of conspicuous consumption suggests that the Minoans may have practiced a more communal or collective form of society, where wealth was shared more evenly among its members."}

One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime.
