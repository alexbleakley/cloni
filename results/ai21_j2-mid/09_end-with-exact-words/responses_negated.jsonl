In the exponential phase, the population grows rapidly, reaching a maximum value called the carrying capacity (K) of the environment. At this point, the population growth slows down and enters the saturation phase.\n\nTo control the population of mosquitoes, reducing the carrying capacity of the environment can be effective. This can be done by reducing the available resources, such as food, water, or shelter, or by modifying the environment to make it less suitable for mosquito survival. By reducing the carrying capacity, the K value decreases, and the population growth slows down, eventually leading to a decline in the population.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer."}

It reflects the change in total revenue that results from selling one more unit of output.\n\nMarginal cost is the additional cost that a firm incurs to produce one additional unit of output. It reflects the change in total cost that results from producing one more unit of output.\n\nAt the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, the firm is producing an output level where total revenue is maximized. In other words, at this output level, the firm is producing and selling enough units to maximize total revenue.\n\nSince total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance, it means that the firm is producing and selling more units than are necessary to cover its costs.

The marginal product of capital (MPC) is 50, which means that the firm can produce 50 additional units of output by employing one more unit of capital.\n\nIf the firm wants to maximize its profit, it should choose the production level that maximizes the marginal product of labor. In this case, the marginal product of labor is 200, so the firm should produce as many units of output as possible.\n\nTo produce as many units of output as possible, the firm should decrease its capital and increase labor. By decreasing capital, the firm frees up more labor, increasing the marginal product of labor. By increasing labor, the firm increases the number of workers available to produce output, further increasing the marginal product of labor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.

Additionally, environmental degradation can exacerbate social and political tensions, which can lead to instability and conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, environmental challenges can also lead to innovation and diversification, which in the long term can bolster military programs. For example, countries may invest in research and development to develop new technologies to address environmental problems, such as renewable energy or sustainable agriculture. These technologies can then be repurposed for military purposes, such as improving energy efficiency or developing new weapons systems.\n\nIn summary, while environmental changes can indeed undermine national security, they can also provide opportunities for innovation and diversification, which in the long term can bolster military programs."}
